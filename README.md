# Machine-Learning-Loan-Lending-Club

Lending-Club are working at a bank and are considering investing in Lending club. Since there are no standard models, they are expected to build prediction models that will help predict the interest rates based on various parameters users would input.


## Part 1: Data wrangling and exploratory data analysis https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action
The goal is to download the data programmatically from the website and create one dataset for the entire database.

Including:
• Data download: How will you download all loan data and create one dataset? How can you timestamp the data so you know when the data was recorded?

• Missing data analysis: How will you handle missing data?

• Feature engineering: What variables do you need to predict interest rates? Ensure users would be
able to give you that information to help you predict rates

• Create one more pipeline to do this for the “Declined Loan data”. Repeat above steps NOTE: NO HUMAN INTERVERSION SHOULD BE NEEDED AT ALL. YOUR LUIGI/AIRFLOW script SHOULD DO EVERYTHING.

Exploratory Data analysis: 
• Write a Jupyter notebook using R/Python to graphically represent different summaries of data. Summarize your findings in this notebook.

• Summarize your key insights about different user profiles, states, loan amounts etc.





## Part II: Building and evaluating models 
The goal is to build a model to predict interest rates. Get leads from people with different profiles and you must decide if it will give loans or not and if it will give a loan, how much interest you would charge for those loans.

Classification 
Use the “Loan Data” and the “Declined Loan Data” datasets to build classification models that will generate a flag whether to give a loan or not.

• Start with logistic regression using Jupyter and Python/R

• Compute ROC curve and Confusion matrices for training and testing datasets and comment on the results.

• Repeat this using Random Forest, Neural Network models algorithms.

• Choose one model you will deploy and implement this model on the Microsoft azure machine learning studio and create a REST API

• Should be able to a new record (You can define what features you will use) and the result will be a flag whether it would give a loan or not.

Clustering 
Decided to give a loan, build models to decide what interest rate to give. Debating whether to create one model for all customer prospects or segment data into clusters and then build prediction models specific to each cluster. think of creating segments or clusters and build models one for each cluster. with 3 possibilities:

1. Segment data into clusters manually using categorical or numerical features.

2. Use a clustering algorithm (that can factor both numerical and categorical variables) and segment data into k clusters. then build prediction models for each cluster.

3. No clusters; Just use data as is
Once do the clustering use t-sne to visualize your clusters for some sample test data. See http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/ for guidance on using t-sne Prediction 

• Write a prediction script in a Jupyter notebook in Python that builds a Regression model for the interest rate using data from the 3 clustering methodologies worked

o Tryvariableselectionandbuildthebestmodelforeachsegment/cluster

o ComputeMAE,RMS,MAPEfortrainingandtestingdatasets

o Repeat this using Random Forest, Neural Network models and KNN algorithms.

o Choose the best model amongst the 4 types of algorithms.

o Deploy the best algorithm/algorithms on Azure ML studio

o Have a bunch of Rest APIs you should be able to choose from based on the cluster the record belongs to Deployment 

Design the following workflow:
• Given a record, use a pre-trained clustering model to cluster the record to a segment.

• Have 3 cluster assignments (1-manual, 2-based on your clustering algorithm, 3-default 1-cluster for all data)

• For each cluster, there should be a RestAPI which is linked to a chosen prediction model. Look up that API and use it to predict the 3 distinct interest rates.

• Select the highest interest rate and return it as your prescribed interest rate.
